- Fundamentals of Python programming
- Problem-solving techniques and debugging
- Using Linux for development
- Introduction to computing systems and logic

---

# What Is Computer Science?

---

# What is Science?

---

# What is Science?

- **Karl Popper**: Science advances through **falsifiability**, where a hypothesis must be testable and capable of being proven wrong.
- **Thomas Kuhn**: Science progresses through **paradigm shifts**, not linear accumulation of knowledge.
- **Paul Feyerabend**: There’s no single **scientific method**; “anything goes” in the advancement of knowledge.

Is computer science **falsifiable**, **progressive**, or **revolutionary**?

---

# What is Computing?

---

# What is Computing?

- **Claude Shannon**: Defined computing as the processing and transmission of information, laying the foundation for **information theory**.
- Is **computing** something humans do, or is it intrinsic to machines?
- How do **algorithms** fit into this?

---

# What is a Computer?

---

# What is a Computer?

- **Turing Machine**: A mathematical abstraction that helps define computation.
- **Physical Computers**: Machines that perform computations following **predefined rules**.

Does a **computer** have to be a machine?

---

# Is Computer Science a Science?

---

# Is Computer Science a Science?

- **Karl Popper**: Does computer science follow the same principles as **falsifiability** in natural sciences?
- **Kuhn’s Paradigms**: Has computer science had **paradigm shifts**, or is it still evolving within a single framework?
- **Feyerabend’s Anarchy**: Is the structure of computer science methodologically diverse enough to be considered scientific?

---

# Thinking Outside the Box

---

# Thinking Outside the Box

- Are we **creating knowledge** in computer science or simply creating **tools**?
- Can computers **discover** things, or are they always bound by human-made rules?
- What happens when **technology** drives the direction of "science"?
---

# Applications of Computer Science

<br>

- Powers everything from mobile apps to self-driving cars
- Enables new fads like **AI**, **machine learning**, and **blockchain**
- Crucial in **healthcare**, **finance**, **entertainment**, and more
- Careers in cybersecurity, software development, research, etc.

---

# Connections to Philosophy, Logic, and Math

<br>

- **Philosophy**: What can computers "know"? Ethical considerations in AI and machine learning
- **Logic**: The foundation of algorithms and computational processes
- **Mathematics**: Discrete math, probability, and calculus in problem-solving and analysis

---

# Introduction to Linux

---

# Why Linux?

<br>

- Linux is widely used in programming, especially for servers, cloud computing, and software development
- It’s open-source, customizable, and free
- Learning Linux will make you comfortable with many development environments

---

# Basic Linux Commands

<br>

- `ls`: List files in the current directory
- `pwd`: Show the current directory
- `cd`: Change the current directory
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory
- `rm`: Remove files or directories
- `cp`: Copy files or directories
- `mv`: Move or rename files
- `cat`: Display the contents of a file
- `grep`: Search for specific patterns or keywords in files
- `find`: Search for files and directories
- `head`/`tail`: View the beginning or end of a file
- `nano` or `vim`: Edit text files

---

# Practical Linux Use Cases

<br>

- **Programming**: Running scripts, compiling code, debugging
- **System Administration**: Managing files, processes, and services
- **Cybersecurity**: Network security tools, penetration testing

---

# Introduction to Python

---

# Why Python?

<br>

- **Easy to Learn**: Simple syntax, great for beginners
- **Versatile**: Used for web development, data science, AI, automation, etc.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Python has libraries for almost every task, from machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow) to web development (e.g., Django)
- **Growing Popularity**: One of the most in-demand programming languages

---

# Python in the Real World

<br>

- **Web Development**: Building websites and APIs (e.g., Instagram, Reddit)
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Analyze large datasets, build AI models (e.g., Netflix recommendations, Google search)
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like file management or web scraping
- **Cybersecurity**: Write scripts to automate penetration testing and security checks
